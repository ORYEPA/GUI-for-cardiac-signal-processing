# GUI for cardiac signal processing


The fundamental purpose of this project is to carry out an exhaustive analysis of cardiac signals. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the characteristics and behaviors of these signals, with the objective of advancing the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac conditions by means of precision technical and analytical methods.

#### Signal deployment:

In the framework of the present project, in addition to the intrinsic signal analysis, the capability to manage multiple file formats has been implemented. This functionality allows working directly with native MATLAB files (extension ".mat"), as well as files in ".csv", ".dat" and ".edf" formats. The integration of this feature eliminates the need to convert files using external tools, consolidating all necessary operations within a single program. This approach not only optimizes the workflow, but also improves the efficiency of the signal analysis process.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal normalization is an essential process in cardiac data processing, the primary objective of which is to standardize the amplitude of recorded signals to facilitate comparative analysis and automatic detection of abnormalities. This procedure adjusts for amplitude variations that may be due to differences in instrumentation, electrode placement or individual physiological characteristics of patients. By applying normalization techniques, a uniform data format is achieved, which is crucial for the implementation of analysis and diagnostic algorithms in cardiac monitoring systems and telemedicine applications. In addition, normalization significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of epidemiological and clinical studies that rely on the interpretation of large volumes of ECG data.

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a fundamental mathematical tool in frequency analysis that allows decomposing this temporal signal into its frequency components. This process is indispensable for identifying and quantifying the different cardiac rhythms and anomalies that can manifest themselves in the specific frequencies of the signal. The application of FFT in the context of ECG facilitates the detection of arrhythmias, ischemia and other cardiac disorders by providing a clear and accurate representation of the energy distributed over various frequency bands. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of FFT makes it particularly suitable for real-time analysis, as well as for implementation in portable cardiac monitoring devices, resulting in a valuable tool in both clinical practice and cardiovascular research.

The Power Spectral Density (PSD) in an Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) refers to the distribution of power or energy across different frequency components within the EKG signal. In a typical EKG signal, the PSD reveals distinct peaks and patterns corresponding to various physiological phenomena, such as heart rate and rhythm. The PSD analysis helps in understanding the frequency characteristics of the cardiac signal, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms of cardiac function and abnormalities. Specifically, it can highlight frequency components associated with normal sinus rhythm, arrhythmias, or other cardiac conditions.

Understanding the peaks and waves of an ECG, including the R and S waves, is crucial for interpreting cardiac health and diagnosing abnormalities. The R wave represents ventricular depolarization, signifying the contraction of the ventricles, while the S wave indicates the completion of ventricular depolarization. Identifying the characteristics of these waves aids in determining the regularity of heart rhythm, detecting arrhythmias, and assessing myocardial function. For instance, abnormalities in the R wave, such as its amplitude or duration, can suggest myocardial infarction or ventricular hypertrophy. Similarly, changes in the S wave morphology may indicate conduction defects or electrolyte imbalances. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of ECG waves, including the R and S waves, is essential for clinicians to make accurate diagnoses and provide appropriate treatment for cardiac patients.

Understanding the peaks in an ECG signal is fundamental for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing various heart conditions. Each peak in the ECG waveform corresponds to specific events in the cardiac cycle, providing critical information about the electrical activity of the heart. For instance, the P wave represents atrial depolarization, indicating the initiation of atrial contraction; the QRS complex signifies ventricular depolarization, reflecting the onset of ventricular contraction; and the T wave indicates ventricular repolarization, marking the recovery of the ventricles. By analyzing the morphology, amplitude, and duration of these peaks, clinicians can identify abnormalities such as arrhythmias, ischemia, myocardial infarction, and conduction disorders. Moreover, monitoring changes in peak characteristics over time allows for the assessment of treatment efficacy and disease progression. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of ECG peaks is essential for clinicians to make accurate diagnoses, formulate treatment plans, and provide optimal care for patients with cardiovascular conditions.

The mean voltage index of an ECG signal holds significant importance in assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various heart conditions. It provides a measure of the average electrical activity of the heart over time, reflecting the overall amplitude and direction of the ECG waveform. By calculating the mean voltage index, clinicians can gain insights into the general magnitude of cardiac electrical activity, which can indicate the presence of hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities, or myocardial damage.
