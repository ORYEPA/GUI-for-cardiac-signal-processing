#### Signal deployment:

In the framework of the present project, in addition to the intrinsic signal analysis, the capability to manage multiple file formats has been implemented. This functionality allows working directly with native MATLAB files (extension ".mat"), as well as files in ".csv", ".dat" and ".edf" formats. The integration of this feature eliminates the need to convert files using external tools, consolidating all necessary operations within a single program. This approach not only optimizes the workflow, but also improves the efficiency of the signal analysis process.
