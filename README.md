# GUI for cardiac signal processing


The fundamental purpose of this project is to carry out an exhaustive analysis of cardiac signals. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the characteristics and behaviors of these signals, with the objective of advancing the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac conditions by means of precision technical and analytical methods.

### User interface for the analysis of biological signals from the heart:

#### Signal deployment:

In the framework of the present project, in addition to the intrinsic signal analysis, the capability to manage multiple file formats has been implemented. This functionality allows working directly with native MATLAB files (extension ".mat"), as well as files in ".csv", ".dat" and ".edf" formats. The integration of this feature eliminates the need to convert files using external tools, consolidating all necessary operations within a single program. This approach not only optimizes the workflow, but also improves the efficiency of the signal analysis process.
